# 3D-Printed-Statues
Problem description:
            I am having a 3D printer to print statues,the magic is i can able to create a new 3D printer from my existing printer.printer takes one day to create a new statue or new printer
           inputs:
                  To create a 'n' statues
           output:
                  Minimum number of days required to print 'n' statues

My logic:
            i/p:5
            o/p:4
            Based on this input i will explain.5 statues want to build, Initially i am having single printer using this i create new printer(takes one day).
            At now i am having 2,3D printers using this 2 printers i can able to create 2 statues per day(Two days over,we created 2 statues).create statues until 5 like this.
           
                         BASED ON INPUT CREATE 3D PRINTER FROM EXISTING PRINTER
